a demo :          znn://aa.bb:80/test?p=12&d=1
uri   can split  to  some part   :
first is scheme      things before ":"
next is host         before first "/"
next is path         after first "/" and before first "?"
and last is param      after "?" split with &

so this project use this to define uri to open app

 <string name="app_scheme">1yxy</string>
 <string name="app_host">1yxy.com</string>
 <string name="path_detail">/detail</string>
 <string name="path_activity">/activity</string>

to open banner activity  ----- uri =  1yxy://1yxy.com/activity
to open good detail      ----- uri =  1yxy://1yxy.com/detail?peroid=51&fightId=8139
